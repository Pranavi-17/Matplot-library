# Project Title:
### Analysis and visualization of Tabular data into Graphics visuals using Matplot Library

# Tools & Technology:
### 1.Jupyter-Notebook
### 2.Python Programming Language
### 3.Matplot LIBRARY (Python Library)
### 4.Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
### A organisation called product based company publishing in2011 hackathon now the organisation wants tabular data into visualisation format,as a data science engineer I have to provide solutions for following task
### TASK 1: Find out what is the maximum and minimum profit value across sales.It is mandatory data in bar graphs only.
### TASK 2; Find out maximum and minimum sales for profit across different categories findout what maximum and minimum sales for profits across different categories all the categories is must in different colors.
### TASK 3: In which month sales view highest profit and loss
### TASK 4: What is the highest age of employee.Visulaisation must be histogram

# Project Approach:
### 1.Visualisation in Python - Matplotlib
### 2.Bar Graph: Plotting sales across each product category
### 3.Adding title and labeling axes in the graph
### 4.Modifying the bars in the graph
### 5.Adjusting tick values and the value labels
### 6..Scatter plot: Plotting sales across each product category
### 7.Adding title and labeling axes in the graph
### 8.Representing product categories using different colors
### 9.Line Chart: Trend of sales over the 12 months
### 10.Histogram: Distibution of employees across different age groups
### 11.Plotting a histogram with fixed number of bins
### 12.Box plot: Understanding the spread of sales across different countries

# Final Result:
